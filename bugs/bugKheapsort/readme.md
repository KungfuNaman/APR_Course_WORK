The analysisGraph folder shows the analysis graph of the log output results.

The dataAnalysisScript folder contains three scripts for processing log data and the output logs.

The output_astor folder stores the output of the jgenprog mode using the Astor tool.

The src and target folders contain the kheapsort bug source code and compiled files respectively.
