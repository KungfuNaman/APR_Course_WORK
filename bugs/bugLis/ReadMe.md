Maven Project for Astor Output Analysis
This Maven project contains a Lis program with a bug, along with its test cases. The primary purpose 
of this project is to analyse the output of astor, a popular program repair tool.

Files Included:
outputLog.txt: This file contains the output log generated after running astor on the program.

pathDiff.diff: A file displaying the differences between the original code and the patched solution 
provided by astor.

patchInfo.json: Contains information and details about the patches generated by astor.

Analyzing the Output:
You can use the provided Python script, analyseAstorOutputScript.py, to analyze astor's output. 
This script offers insights and generates graphs based on the log data. Important information in the 
output is highlighted in red for easy identification.

Data Extraction:
The script generates a file called generation_mapping.json, 
which compiles data for each variant extracted from astor's output. 
This data is presented in a JSON format, simplifying the analysis process.

Graphs for Analysis:
The Generated graph folder includes all the graphs generated during the analysis of the output.
These visuals help in understanding the results of astor's repair attempts.
